                <h4><a href="https://www.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>  |  January 2018 - Present</h4>
                <h5>Masters Degree | GIS and Web Map Programming</h5>
                The University of Wisconsin–Madison has run an award-winning Master’s of Science in Cartography/GIS for many decades.

                The curriculum of our Master’s program is continually revised to teach the latest technologies and techniques in the field of applied GIS and map design. This new online Master’s is the latest pedagogical adjustment in the evolution of the degree. It is by far one of our most ambitious modifications.

                Research has shown that GIS programming, mobile applications, and web mapping our the technologies that are increasingly in demand today and will be for years to come. This is why we have re-created our Master’s to offer professional students an opportunity to focus on these these skill areas.

                The shift from the paper to mobile/web medium caused some mayhem in the GIS industry. Those with a degree in GIS or cartography from as recently as 2005 were suddenly dealing with the challenges of new mediums that do not play well with certain print concepts. <br>

                <h5>Bachelors Degree | Geographic Information Science  |  Urban Systems</h5>
                The Bachelor of Science degree program in Geographic Information Science (GISc) integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology with applied research domains. The GISc degree program aims at producing high caliber graduates who are well trained in the technology, theory, and application of GIS and information systems. Students receive fundamental knowledge of human and physical geography, along with specific content in one of two systems: environmental systems or urban systems. A Geographic Information Science degree provides students a set of skills to manipulate, analyze, assess, and visualize data by way of digital maps and/or map imagery to solve problems in areas like urban and regional design, marketing and industrial location, transportation, precision agriculture, forestry, environmental systems, engineering, epidemiology, emergency services, crime analysis, and utilities.
